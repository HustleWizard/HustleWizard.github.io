	<h2>Why Thompson's Teeth?</h2>

	<p>Just like many of you, we understand the struggles that you face everyday. We know how it feels to drag your teeth down a strip of bark and feel teeth splinter. <br> We KNOW how it feels to pour a delicious bowl of Teethio's (TM), only to have your feeble human teeth shatter into a million bloody little pieces. That's why here at Thompson's Teeth, we like to think <br> ourselves as dream makers. Long gone are the days of bloody gums and being unable to gnaw off an "unnecessary" limb. Because with Thompson's Teeth, we want you to be able to freely express your will <br> to bite into anything, or any person! After all, that's the Earthican way!</p>
